# Design notes

> Interpretive analysis of the parameter schema used by Dolby DAX3 tuning XML (distributed publicly as part of Windows audio driver packages), for the purpose of Linux interoperability. No verbatim tuning arrays are reproduced.

Why the generated EasyEffects preset looks the way it does. The README covers *what*
the script emits; this doc covers the architectural *why*, so future readers don't
have to reverse-engineer it from commit history.

## Dolby's signal flow: CP → VLLDP

DAX3 splits processing into two stages, reflected in the XML under `tuning-cp` and
`tuning-vlldp`:

```
┌────────────── Content Processing (CP, software) ───────────────┐
│                                                                │
│  Input → Dialog Enhancer → IEQ → Volume Leveler → Regulator    │

```

- **CP** is content-dependent: dialog enhancement, intelligent EQ, volume leveling.
  It's Media-Intelligence-steered — Dolby analyses the audio content in real time
  and tells these stages when to hold or act.
- **VLLDP** is speaker-dependent: correction curves, per-channel biquads, multiband
  dynamics, and a per-band regulator that clamps specific frequency ranges to
  protect physical drivers.

The generated EasyEffects chain mirrors this split as closely as LV2 plugins allow.

## Plugin chain order

Current order (see `make_preset` in `dolby_to_easyeffects.py`):

```
Convolver → Stereo Tools → Equalizer (PEQ) → Dialog Enhancer EQ
    → Autogain → MB Compressor → Regulator → Limiter
```

Rationale for the non-obvious ordering decisions:

- **Autogain sits before the compressor**, not at the chain end (commit `7de8866`).
  Earlier versions followed the "autogain always last" EasyEffects convention, but
  that put the volume leveler downstream of everything with no safety net — any
  post-silence overshoot went straight to the output. Moving autogain upstream of
  the compressor and regulator matches Dolby's CP → VLLDP boundary: the volume
  leveler is in CP, the dynamics stages are in VLLDP, and the VLLDP stages catch
  overshoot from CP.

- **A brickwall limiter is appended at the chain end** (commit `1b14bc1`) even
  though the regulator already performs per-band limiting. Cross-device data
  (`docs/cross-device-findings.md` §6) shows 53% of devices use
  `regulator-distortion-slope=16` — a true brickwall — while the other 47% use a
  softer slope. The explicit LSP limiter is redundant on the brickwall-slope
  devices and essential on the rest.

- **Dialog enhancer runs before the volume leveler** (commit `1709e5d`). Dolby
  boosts speech energy before measuring loudness so the leveler doesn't over-react
  to dialog-heavy passages.

## Gain-staging budget

Each stage in the chain is a potential gain trap. The key decisions:

| Stage | Gain | Reason |
|-------|------|--------|
| Convolver (FIR peak-normalized) | 0 dB | Script normalizes the FIR so peak frequency response = 0 dB |
| Convolver plugin `autogain` | **explicitly `false`** | EasyEffects' default is `true`, which re-normalizes by RMS power. Our minimum-phase FIR concentrates energy at the peak sample → RMS power ≈ 0.00001 → the default would apply a **+50 dB boost**. Commit `5973326` disables it. |
| PEQ `output-gain` | narrowband-scaled | Compensates for the highest PEQ bell gain, but scaled down for narrow-Q bells because a Q=4.6 bell only boosts a thin slice of spectrum. Commit `c36907c` relaxed this from full compensation. |
| Regulator `output-gain` (volmax) | +6 dB typical (device/profile-specific) | Dolby's `volmax-boost` (the volume-leveler's loudness-maximiser ceiling) is applied here as a static approximation of VolMax. Primary slot: `multiband_compressor#1.output-gain`. If the regulator is disabled or absent, the gain falls back to `limiter#0.input-gain`. Can be turned off with `--disable volmax`. Commit `19a1f99` had removed a prior (wrongly-placed) mapping to MBC output-gain; this re-adds it in a topologically correct spot. |
| MBC upward compression | **0 dB** | LSP plugin defaults enable upward compression below `boost-threshold=-72 dB`. Dolby's compressor is purely downward. Commit `e454711` disables it on both MBC instances. |
| Regulator upward compression | **0 dB** | Same LSP default issue — upward compression on a *limiter* is especially wrong. Also fixed in `e454711`. |
| Output limiter | −1 dBFS | Final catch-all for inter-sample peaks after everything else. |

With these fixes in place, the normal-operation surplus is small enough that content
sits at target loudness without the regulator triggering, and worst-case quiet-input
scenarios are caught by the brickwall limiter rather than clipping the output.

## Why autogain is bypassed by default

The EasyEffects autogain is configured from Dolby's `volume-leveler` parameters
(target, history window, reference) but shipped with `bypass: true` by default
(commit `19a1f99`). Three reasons:

1. **Dolby's volume leveler is MI-steered.** The XML enables
   `mi-dv-leveler-steering-enable` only on the `dynamic` profile
   (`docs/cross-device-findings.md` §11), meaning Dolby analyses content to hold
   gain during silence rather than continuously pumping it up.
2. **EasyEffects autogain has no content awareness.** It treats silence as "too
   quiet" and cranks gain up over its integration window (10–30 s). When loud
   content arrives after silence, the first 400 ms–3 s of EBU R 128 integration
   are still running with the "quiet-period" gain → audible saturation / pumping.
3. **Bypassing is better than guessing.** Commits `67ac464` (−23 LUFS target) and
   `ec78b0d` (longer history window) softened the effect, but neither fixes the
   root cause. Shipping bypassed keeps the settings available for users who want
   to enable it manually without re-running the script.

## Verified math (sanity checks)

A few numerical things the script depends on that aren't documented in the README:

**Q15 block-rate time constants** (MB compressor attack/release coefficients). Stored
as exponential smoothing coefficients operating per block (256 samples at 48 kHz =
187.5 blocks/sec). Decoded via:

```
tau_seconds = -1 / (blocks_per_sec * ln(coeff / 32768))
```

Verified against the standard first-order LPF time-constant derivation. For the
development device (ALC287 22E6):

| Band | Attack raw | Release raw | Attack ms | Release ms |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 0    | 24080     | 32123       | 17.3      | 268.3      |
| 1    | 22641     | 30810       | 14.4      | 86.6       |

These are reasonable values for a two-band music compressor.

**FIR accuracy**. The minimum-phase cepstral method used to generate the IEQ +
audio-optimizer impulse response produces **exact** frequency response at all 20
Dolby band centers (error < 0.001 dB). The FIR is properly minimum-phase (100% of
the energy is in the first half of the 4096 taps), has no significant tail ringing,
and extrapolates flat beyond the band edges. 4096 taps (~85 ms at 48 kHz) is
sufficient for 20-band EQ correction.

**FIR time-domain envelope** (Dolby-Balanced, Dynamic, X1 Yoga Gen 7, channel L,
peak-normalized; reproduce with `tools/measure_ee/compare_ir_time_domain.py`):

|                              | converter FIR (`Dolby-Balanced.irs`) | EE-captured | DAX-captured |
|------------------------------|---:|---:|---:|
| total samples (file)         | 4096 (85.3 ms) | 8192 (170.7 ms) | 8192 (170.7 ms) |
| 95% cumulative energy        | peak + 1.15 ms | peak + 2.79 ms | peak + 1.29 ms |
| 99% cumulative energy        | peak + 5.50 ms | peak + 7.21 ms | peak + 3.62 ms |
| 99.9% cumulative energy      | peak + 11.19 ms | peak + 13.77 ms | peak + 8.21 ms |
| envelope first &lt; −60 dB   | peak + 19.94 ms | peak + 23.29 ms | peak + 11.40 ms |
| envelope first &lt; −80 dB   | peak + 49.88 ms | peak + 51.19 ms | peak + 23.15 ms |

The converter FIR and the EE-captured IR have nearly identical decay profiles —
expected, since EE *is* the convolver applying that FIR. The DAX-captured IR
decays roughly 2× faster (−60 dB at 11 ms post-peak vs ~22 ms). What looks
like a "long" loopback IR in a stereogram view is the −60 to −100 dB tail; on
a log-envelope scale the post-peak tail of all three IRs falls below the
audible threshold within ~25–50 ms.

The 99% cumulative-energy time (peak + 5.5 ms for the converter FIR) is what
matters for "where is the impulse-response actually doing work." The remaining
~80 ms of the 4096-tap file is the natural decay of the lowest-frequency
biquads in the cepstral construction (a 100 Hz HP at Q ≈ 0.7 has a several-ms
time-constant; the trailing &lt;−60 dB samples encode its asymptotic decay).
Trimming earlier than that loses LF accuracy, not visible "blank space."

## Empirical comparison vs DAX3 on Windows

Issue #11 raised an interesting side question: how does the FIR our converter
generates from the XML compare to what Dolby's DAX3 implementation actually
does on Windows? The XML is magnitude-only — there's no phase reference for
the IEQ + audio-optimizer combined response — so the question can only be
answered empirically.

The measurement tooling lives at `tools/measure_dax/`. It plays a stimulus
through the speaker output, captures the post-DAX3 signal via WASAPI loopback,
and analyses the result. A Linux-side counterpart at `tools/measure_ee/`
runs the same stimulus battery through a live EasyEffects instance with our
generated preset and produces analyzer-compatible captures, so the EE-on-Linux
and DAX-on-Windows responses can be overlaid for the same XML and profile.
Five stimulus kinds:

- **sweep** (exponential 20 Hz–22 kHz, −18 dBFS peak): Farina deconvolution
  recovers an LTI IR if the system is LTI.
- **sweep_quiet** (−42 dBFS peak): same sweep at much lower input level.
- **pink / pink_quiet**: stationary pink noise; steady-state magnitude after
  the leveler settles.
- **multitone**: 20 pure tones at the Dolby band centers; per-band amplitude
  *and phase* via single-bin DFT.

Captured on a ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 7 (Realtek ALC287, subsystem 17AA:22E6 —
matches the development XML at `localresearch/DEV_0287_SUBSYS_17AA22E6_*`).

### Finding 1: DAX3 is non-LTI for our stimuli

The volume leveler / regulator engage during capture and apply time-varying,
content-adaptive gain. Symptoms:

- 100 ms RMS envelope of the swept-sine capture varies by 16–34 dB from
  start to end of the sweep, depending on profile (vs flat ±0 dB on the
  OFF baseline). The leveler boosts late-sweep portions where the input
  fade-out drops the level.
- Multitone clipped on 4 of 6 profiles (dynamic, movie, music, game) —
  peak hit 0 dBFS with up to 113 clipped samples. The regulator engaged
  as a hard limiter even at −18 dBFS RMS input.
- For sweep at −18 dBFS, captured peaks reached ~−0.5 dBFS on the
  aggressive profiles (dynamic / movie / music / game). At −42 dBFS the
  leveler is *more* aggressive, not less (it's targeting a fixed loudness
  and brings quiet content up).

This means the recovered "IR" is not a true linear impulse response —
Farina deconvolution conflates frequency response with the time-varying
gain applied during the sweep. A clean LTI characterization of DAX3 is not
possible without disabling the leveler / regulator (which Dolby Access
doesn't expose), or sending continuously-stationary stimuli that give the
leveler a fixed level to settle on (which is what the pink stimuli do).

### Finding 2: DAX3's phase is hybrid, not pure min-phase or linear-phase

Sweep captures, post-peak vs pre-peak energy ratio (channel L). Pure
minimum-phase would be +∞ dB; linear-phase would be ~0 dB.

| profile | sweep (−18 dBFS) | sweep_quiet (−42 dBFS) |
|---------|-----------------:|-----------------------:|
| OFF     |  +0.0 dB (linear) |  +0.0 dB (linear) — bandlimited Dirac, expected |
| dynamic | +14.6 dB | +18.7 dB |
| movie   | +10.4 dB | +18.1 dB |
| music   | +15.7 dB | +19.4 dB |
| game    | +10.0 dB | +17.8 dB |
| voice   |  +8.6 dB |  +8.8 dB |

Every DAX3-on profile sits between linear-phase and minimum-phase. Voice
is closest to linear-phase (+8.6 dB) — likely a deliberate choice for
speech, where flat group delay preserves consonant transients. The
sweep_quiet variant looks more min-phase-like across profiles, but this
is most plausibly an artifact of the leveler's asymmetric response to a
quiet sweep, not a real phase shift.

This rules out our generated FIR matching DAX3's exact phase behaviour
in any profile. Per the no-added-latency constraint we don't switch our
converter to linear-phase regardless of this finding — minimum-phase is
the right trade-off for an EQ correction filter, and we accept that this
diverges from Dolby's choice.

### Finding 3: DAX3 doesn't faithfully implement the published XML curves

Each profile's captured spectrum vs **its own** balanced FIR target,
between-band magnitude residual on a 200-point log grid (47–19688 Hz):

| profile | sweep | sweep_quiet | pink | pink_quiet |
|---------|-------|-------------|------|-----------:|
| dynamic | 9.2 / 31.4 dB | 6.9 / 24.2 | 7.2 / 27.1 | 7.5 / 25.9 |
| movie   | 11.9 / 37.2 | 7.3 / 25.4 | 7.5 / 28.1 | 7.6 / 26.3 |
| music   | **7.3 / 21.6** | **5.1 / 19.6** | 5.9 / 20.4 | 6.5 / 20.4 |
| game    | 11.8 / 37.2 | 7.3 / 24.6 | 7.5 / 28.1 | 7.8 / 26.7 |
| voice   | 9.8 / 30.8 | 9.6 / 30.2 | 9.6 / 31.8 | 9.9 / 33.1 |

(`RMS / max` in dB; captured spectrum minus our FIR's frequency response.)

For comparison, the synthetic LTI test (apply our FIR to the stimulus,
deconvolve, compare to original) recovers within **0.06 dB RMS / 0.36 dB
max** — three orders of magnitude tighter. The captured DAX3 response is
genuinely far from what our FIR predicts, not a measurement artifact.

The bulk of the residual sits at HF (>5 kHz). At 19688 Hz the captured
magnitude is typically 20–40 dB above what the XML's combined IEQ + AO
target predicts. **DAX3 does not apply the deep HF rolloff that the
published XML implies.** This is the most actionable finding — it
suggests either (a) DAX3 ships a separate HF-shaping stage we're not
modelling, (b) the audio_optimizer block is a target-response curve that
DAX3 inverts internally rather than applying directly, or (c) the
specific IEQ "Balanced" curve in Dolby Access doesn't correspond to the
`ieq_balanced` block in the XML. Finding 4 (below) rules (c) out via a
Linux-side EE-loopback capture of the same XML; disambiguating (a) vs
(b) still needs either a Dolby-side reference or a stripped-down
single-block tuning XML.

The Music profile fits its XML target most closely (RMS 5–7 dB).
Dynamic, Movie, Game cluster around 7–12 dB RMS. Voice deviates the
most (9–10 dB RMS).

### Finding 4: EE-on-Linux follows the XML; the gap is on DAX's side

With the new `tools/measure_ee/` Linux-side capture (same 5 stimuli,
same `analyze.py`, same XML reference), we can place EE and DAX side by
side for the same profile. Pink-noise steady-state, Dynamic / Balanced,
ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 7 (DEV_0287_SUBSYS_17AA22E6), normalized at 1 kHz:

| freq | EE (dB) | DAX (dB) | Δ EE−DAX |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 47 Hz | −36.5 | −28.4 | −8.1 |
| 234 Hz | +19.4 | +16.3 | +3.1 |
| 1 kHz | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2.25 kHz | +16.6 | +12.4 | +4.2 |
| 5.8 kHz | +0.1 | +3.3 | −3.2 |
| 11.25 kHz | −6.8 | +2.5 | −9.3 |
| 13.9 kHz | −14.0 | +2.2 | −16.2 |
| 19.7 kHz | −27.5 | +0.7 | −28.1 |

(Reproduce with `tools/measure_ee/compare_ee_vs_dax.py` after running
the EE battery and the DAX battery through `analyze.py` — see
`tools/measure_ee/README.md`.)

EE follows the converter's XML interpretation within ≤3 dB across most
of the band — same shape, same band centers, same depths. DAX
diverges most where the XML target is most extreme (deep HF rolloff
in `ieq_balanced + audio_optimizer`): at 19.7 kHz the XML target
predicts roughly −43 dB, EE applies −27 dB (the FIR doesn't reach the
target's depth), and DAX applies +1 dB.

This rules out hypothesis (c) from Finding 3 (the wrong `ieq_*` curve)
— our converter and EE agree on which curve is in play, and they
agree on its magnitude shape. The remaining hypotheses are (a) DAX
ships a separate HF-shaping stage we're not modeling, or (b) DAX
treats `audio_optimizer` as a target-response that it inverts before
applying. Loopback can't distinguish them without a controlled
single-block A/B (e.g., a tuning XML stripped down to a single block
at a time), but the gap is unambiguously on DAX's side, not the
converter's.

The 47 Hz deviation (−8 dB EE vs −28 dB DAX, both relative to 1 kHz)
is partly the EE chain's `equalizer#0 band0` HP at 100 Hz / x2 slope
(≈4th-order rolloff that takes us deeper than the XML target alone)
and partly DAX's volume regulator boosting LF tones at low input
levels — the multitone capture, where the leveler can lock onto a
single 47 Hz sine for 12 s, shows DAX at −14 dB (vs EE −37 dB), a
23 dB gap that's much bigger than the pink-noise gap and consistent
with leveler boost rather than steady-state EQ.

### Implications for the converter

Our `make_fir` produces a faithful min-phase FIR of `IEQ + audio_optimizer`
within ≤0.001 dB of the band-center target — the math is correct. What
we cannot reproduce on Linux without additional reverse-engineering:

1. **DAX3's hybrid-phase character.** Out of scope: linear-phase costs
   ~42 ms of group delay, ruled out by the no-added-latency constraint.
2. **DAX3's apparent flatter HF response.** Finding 4 narrows the
   space to hypothesis (a) or (b) — (c) is ruled out, our converter
   and EE agree on which `ieq_*` curve is being applied and on its
   magnitude. Resolving (a) vs (b) needs a controlled single-block
   A/B (a stripped-down XML), not a structural change to the converter.
3. **DAX3's non-LTI dynamics** (leveler, regulator engaging during
   playback). EasyEffects' autogain is bypassed by default already
   (see "Why autogain is bypassed by default" above) — adding a
   content-adaptive leveler equivalent would require approximating
   Media Intelligence steering, which is a substantial undertaking.

The captures + analysis tooling under `tools/measure_dax/` are kept for
future debugging — re-running on a new device or after a Dolby driver
update is a one-command repeat.

### Follow-ups to close the gap to DAX

These are not committed yet — listed here so the next session can pick
them up. Effectiveness varies; the cheap A/B'able ones are at the top.

**Cheap experiments worth A/B'ing on real content:**

1. **Try `IEQ − AO` instead of `IEQ + AO` in the FIR target.** Tests
   hypothesis (b) — DAX inverting `audio_optimizer` before applying.
   One-line flag in `dolby_to_easyeffects.py`. If EE response moves
   toward DAX after the change, hypothesis (b) wins; if further away,
   (a) wins.
2. **Drop a small attenuation bell at 2.25 kHz in `equalizer#1`.** The
   user preset currently has `+1.88 dB / Q 0.7 @ 2500 Hz`. Replacing
   with `−4 dB / Q ≈ 1 @ 2250 Hz` would close the ~4 dB upper-mid
   over-boost without touching the FIR. Listening pass on dialogue.
3. **Soften the HP at 100 Hz from `x2` slope to `x1`.** Closes part
   of the LF gap (8 dB pink, 23 dB multitone at 47 Hz). Risk: small
   speakers benefit from the steeper HP for excursion limiting —
   listening pass on bass-heavy content before merging.
4. **Run the EE battery on the other four profiles** (Movie / Music /
   Game / Voice). Today's data is Dynamic only. If the HF gap is
   profile-independent, hypothesis (a) is more likely; if it scales
   with `IEQ + AO` magnitude, hypothesis (b) is more likely. No code
   change.

**Diagnostic, no code change:**

5. **Audit the XML schema for blocks `parse_xml` skips.** If there's
   an HF-shaping element in `tuning-vlldp` we don't currently parse,
   that's the simplest explanation for the 28 dB gap. Quick grep
   through the cohort under `localresearch/`.
6. **Stripped-down single-block tuning XML A/B on Windows.** Disable
   everything except IEQ in a tuning XML and capture DAX. Risk: needs
   driver-level XML replacement, could brick DAX on the test machine
   until restoration. Scope before attempting.

**Out of scope unless a constraint changes:**

7. **Match DAX's hybrid phase character** — partial-linear-phase FIR,
   adds ~20–40 ms group delay. Ruled out by no-added-latency
   constraint; needs an explicit decision to relax that.
8. **Approximate DAX's leveler / regulator** — closes the multitone-LF
   gap and the −18 vs −42 dBFS sweep difference. Substantial RE
   effort; naively re-enabling EE autogain reintroduces the pumping
   trap (see "Why autogain is bypassed by default").

**Pragmatic shortcut if RE proves too expensive:**

9. **Empirically tune the preset to match DAX's *captured* response,**
   not the XML's published curves. Fit a FIR + biquad chain to the
   DAX pink-noise capture directly. Loses the "we faithfully apply
   the published XML" property but produces a Linux preset that
   audibly matches Windows. Could be opt-in via a flag so the
   principled path stays the default.

## Rejected approaches

Things that were investigated and explicitly declined, recorded so they don't get
re-proposed:

- **Noise gate before the compressor.** Would prevent noise-floor amplification, but
  real content rarely has an audible noise floor at the levels that trigger the
  compressor. Adds complexity for no practical benefit.
- **GPU compute for FIR convolution.** See `docs/alternative-pipelines.md` Option 5.
  The FIR convolver uses <0.1% of a single CPU core; there's no CPU pressure, and
  CPU→GPU round-trip latency is unacceptable for realtime audio.
- **Custom SOF DSP topology with FIR + DRC modules.** See `docs/alternative-pipelines.md`
  Option 2. Highest offload potential, but requires rebuilding signed firmware and
  custom topology files — too much maintenance burden for a workstation tool.
- **Parametric-EQ approximation of the IEQ curve** (instead of FIR). Produced ±4–5 dB
  ripple between Dolby's 20 band centers regardless of how the solver was tuned.
  See the README's "IEQ target curves are composite targets" table for the full
  comparison.
- **Auto-trimming the convolver IR to its audible length.** Issue #11 noted that the
  4096-tap (~85 ms) IR has a long sub-noise-floor tail. A sweep across 729 FIRs from
  11 device groups (Realtek HDA, Senary, Qualcomm, AMD, ThinkPad / IdeaPad / AIO
  variants) measured trim length as the smallest cutoff beyond which every tail
  sample is below the FIR's peak by ≥ N dB, rounded up to a 64-sample boundary.
  Distributions of trimmed length as % of the original 4096 taps:

  | threshold | mean | p10 | p50 | p90 | max | mean ms saved |
  |-----------|-----:|----:|----:|----:|----:|--------------:|
  | −80 dB    |  48% | 34% | 52% | 55% | 66% |       ~44 ms  |
  | −90 dB    |  54% | 50% | 53% | 63% | 78% |       ~39 ms  |
  | −100 dB   |  60% | 52% | 56% | 73% | 94% |       ~34 ms  |
  | −110 dB   |  69% | 53% | 66% | 91% |100% |       ~26 ms  |
  | −120 dB   |  81% | 63% | 80% | 98% |100% |       ~17 ms  |

  Per-device means at −100 dB clustered tightly (56–69% across all codecs except
  one 3-FIR outlier at 88%) — not device-specific. So the trim would be safe to
  ship. But EasyEffects' Convolver wraps `libzita-convolver` directly and calls
  `Convproc::configure(2, 2, kernel.sampleCount(), bufferSize, bufferSize, Convproc::MAXPART, density)`
  ([EE source][ee-conv]) — i.e. `minpart == quantum == bufferSize`. zita-convolver
  is a non-uniform partitioned FFT convolver where I/O latency is set by the
  first (smallest) partition and progressively larger partitions process the
  tail; with `minpart` pegged to the audio quantum the convolver adds zero
  latency on top of the PipeWire buffer for any IR length up to multi-second IRs.
  So trimming would save ~½ of an already <0.1%-of-a-core convolver workload and
  ~16 KB per file with no audible or perceptible-latency change. Not worth the
  maintenance cost of a threshold parameter that would invite future "is this
  audible?" re-litigation each time the cepstral construction is touched.
